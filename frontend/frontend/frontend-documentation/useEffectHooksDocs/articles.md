### `useEffect` in fetching all shopping articles

The `useEffect` hook in this code is used to fetch all shopping articles from the backend when the component is mounted (i.e., when the component is first rendered). This is done by passing an empty dependency array `[]`, which ensures the effect runs only once when the component loads.

1. **Initial Setup**: The effect is set up to run once when the component is mounted (since the dependency array is empty). This fetches the list of all shopping articles from the server as soon as the component loads.

2. **Fetching Data**: Inside the effect, an asynchronous function `fetchData` is defined and immediately invoked. It makes a `GET` request to the `/getAllShoppingArticles` endpoint to retrieve all available shopping articles.

3. **Handling Response**: Upon a successful response, the result is parsed as JSON. If the response structure includes `result.data.shoppingArticles`, the state `articles` is updated with this data using the `setArticles` function. If the expected data is not found or the structure is unexpected, an error message is logged, and `setArticles` is called with an empty array to ensure the `articles` state is correctly initialized.

This `useEffect` ensures that the component fetches the list of all shopping articles when it is first rendered, and it manages both successful and failed requests gracefully by updating the `articles` state accordingly.
